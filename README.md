# Optimization of BEV Methods based on HoP module
</div>

</br>


# Abstract
In this work, we realize a state-of-the-art method named HoP on two temporal BEV methods, which is published from [HoP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00967). HoP is a plug-and-play approch which can be easily incorporated into BEV detection frameworks, including BEVFormer and BEVDet series. However, the author of HoP just publish the implementation of BEVDet. This work completed the implementation of BEVFormer and SparseBEV. Detailed information about HoP, BEVFormer, SparseBEV can be found in [HoP](https://github.com/Sense-X/HoP), [BEVFormer](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/BEVFormer) and [SparseBEV](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/SparseBEV)
